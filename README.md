# FPGA Tug of War - January 2018 â€“ April 2018
https://github.com/JonathanC13/TugOfWar

## Description

The project was more directed and structured.

-	Implemented the game Tug Of War on a FPGA board using Verilog. The board had buttons to interact with the game and change the game's state, which was represented by LEDs on the board.
-	The testing method used was to test each possible transition for each game state by driving the signals through software and observing the outputs signals from the FPGA. 

## End Remark

    The project went very well, thank you to my project and lab partner Anthony Nauth.
  
    Sincerly,
